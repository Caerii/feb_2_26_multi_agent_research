## Notes for Future Agents

1. **When adding new papers**, update ALL relevant views in this file
2. **For batch analysis**, consider creating separate `BATCH_X_TAXONOMY.md` files if needed
3. **GitHub actions** could auto-generate views from a master CSV/JSON data file
4. **Consider migrating to database** (SQL/NoSQL) for easier querying if paper count exceeds 500

---

## Suggested Future Improvements

1. **Create a searchable JSON schema** mapping papers to all tags
2. **Add scoring system** (1-5) for "Virtual Org Relevance" each paper
3. **Add difficulty level tags** (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced) for practitioners
4. **Create implementation summaries** for practical papers (frameworks, tools)
5. **Add citation relationships** between papers
